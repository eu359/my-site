    <h1> Reading Reflections </h1>
    <p>I was once almost a Comparative Literature major, but alas, my life changed direction. I still do enjor reading, although with school and work, it's taken me much longer to get through books. 
    <p> I usually follow this technique where I reflect on specific quotes/paragraphs, and write these thoughts down on those larger colorful post it notes. It wokred for a while, but they've been getting crumbled and messy. 
    <p> This is an attempt to somehow record these ideas and reflectons.
